ELK STACK PROJECT.

This is a collection of Linux Scripts and ansible Scripts from my CyberClass.
Most of the scripts are used to configure cloud servers with different containers.

The final setup was 4 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jump box and a server running an ELK stack container.
